SnowTricks, a Symfony project
=============================
# How to install this project
## Prerequisites
Your need to install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) in order to use this project.
## Installation
- Clone the repository via git, or download it.
```
git clone https://github.com/Nabil001/snowtricks.git.
```
- Go to the project's root folder and run composer.
```
composer install
```
- Check that you have a parameters.yml located in app/config folder (it should be auto-generated by composer installation).
- Edit parameters.yml file, according to the desired settings (characters between brackets must be replaced by a valid value).
```
parameters:
    database_host: [DATABASE HOST]
    database_port: [DATABASE PORT]
    database_name: [DATABASE NAME]
    database_user: [DATABASE USER]
    database_password: [DATABASE PASSWORD]
    mailer_user: [MAILER USER] # edit the mailer user if you want the app to be able to send emails
    mailer_password: [MAILER PASSWORD] # # edit the mailer password if you want the app to be able to send emails
    secret: [AUTO-GENERATED KEY]

```
- If the app is intended to be able to send emails, then the swiftmailer section in the app/config/config.yml file should be configured : remove the spool option, and reset the transport, encryption and authentification mode parameters if you'll not be using Gmail (mailer's username and password should be set in the parameters.yml file). Otherwise, all emails sent by the app will end up in a swiftmailer/ folder located at the root of the project.
```
swiftmailer:
    transport: smtp
    encryption: ssl
    auth_mode: login
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    username: '%mailer_user%'
    password: '%mailer_password%'
    spool: # to be removed
        type: file # to be removed
        path: '%kernel.project_dir%/swiftmailer' # to be removed
```
- In order to create the database that will be used by the app, run :
```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
```
- Then, to implement the physical data model, run :
```
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```
- Last but not least : you now can populate the trick table thanks to a sample configured in the app/init/ folder. To do this, run the following customized command :
```
php bin/console snowtricks:initialize
```
You should be all set !
